# Description

This repo contains the implementation of a small AI project in which several agents try to reach a gol. The fist attempt is going to be a genetic algorithm and maybe I will keep going with some more experimentation.

The main logic and implemention of the code have been inspired on the codes from `The coding train` ([really interesting youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw)) and a [great tutorial](https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/#basic-game-design) of `pygame` from `Jon Fincher`.
